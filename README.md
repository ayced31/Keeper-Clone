## Google Keeper App Clone

Hey Everyone, I wanted to share the Keeper App with all of you as my latest web development using React. I used concepts I've learned thus far to develop this webpage with the help of the amazing Angela Yu.

Even though I'm still learning, I wanted to appreciate my accomplishments because this project accurately represents my growth and advancement in web development.

Through building this app, I've honed my skills in:
1. React Styling: Leveraging CSS to design a clean and user-friendly interface.
2. React Components: Structuring the app with reusable components like Header, Note, and Footer for a modular architecture.
3. React Props: Passing data between components efficiently to ensure seamless communication.
4. React Hooks: Utilizing useState for managing state and useEffect for side effects, enhancing functionality and performance.
5. Managing Component Tree: Organizing the component hierarchy effectively to maintain a clear and manageable structure.
6. React Dependencies: Integrating external libraries like Material-UI for UI components, expanding the app's functionality while maintaining dependency management.

I am excited to continue learning and refining my React skills! ðŸš€ðŸ’» #ReactJS #WebDevelopment #ProjectShowcase
